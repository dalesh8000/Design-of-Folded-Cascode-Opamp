# Design-of-Folded-Cascode-Opamp
To design a high-performance folded cascode operational amplifier with a focus on maximizing gain, bandwidth, and power efficiency while maintaining stability and linearity. The design will emphasize minimizing noise and offset voltage, achieving a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and ensuring robustness across process, voltage, and temperature variations. The final implementation will be evaluated based on its suitability for use in low-power analog and mixed-signal applications, where precision and reliability are critical.
